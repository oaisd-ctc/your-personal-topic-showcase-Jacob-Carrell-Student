            <p>The vast and experimental world of Dungeon Synth music is quite different from the pop, rap, or any other popular music you might be used to. 
            Artists from around the world focus on creating massive and atmospheric worlds with ambient music that ranges in tone from hopeful and serene to dark and malevolent.
            While Dungeon Synth artists primarily focus on creating fantasy and/or medieval style music, there are far more styles and subgenres than one might assume. Ranging from things like Winter Synth, Keller Synth, Funeral Synth, and even Dino Synth.</p>

        <div class="history">

            <p>Dungeon Synth has it's roots in the early black metal scene in late 80's/early 90's Norway. The genre employs aesthetics and themes typically associated with black metal juxtaposed to the typical heavy tremolo-picking, blast-beats, and harsh, shrieked vocals of black metal by way of compositions of instrumental or ambient music commonly used as introductions, interludes, or "outros" in ordinary black metal.
                It's history is rich and vast. If you want more specific details of it's upbringing and eventual appreciation by many people today, check out the About page linked above.</p>
