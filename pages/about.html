        <p>As stated before, Dungeon Synth can draw it's origins from black metal artists in Norway. Many black metal bands already used atmospheric synths in their music.
            Whether it be induvidual songs in a album, a single, or even an intro or outro to their other songs. But ambient music really started to take off with the introduction of people like Jim Kirkwood and Mortiis (formely from the black metal band Emperor).

        <p>Throughout the coming decade, Dungeon Synth would become increasingly more popular amongst black metal enthusiasts, and was starting to cement itself as
            a legitimate style of music. People enjoyed this type of music for many of the same reasons black metal was enjoyed around the time. People were drawn to the dark
            atmosphere, calming but mysterious tone, and the "home made" feel.
        </p>

        <p>Dungeon Synth music has been inspired by many different things. For instance, the afformentioned album by Jim Kirkwood "Where Shadows Lie" was inspired by J.R.R. Tolkien's <em>The Lord of the Rings.</em>
        And much of Varg Vikernes's music (artist behind Burzum) was inspired by numerous Norwegian myths, tales, legends, and folklore.</p>

        <p>Nowadays, Dungeon Synth spans across many subgenres and styles, so you'd be pretty hard-pressed to not find a style of Dungeon Synth you like. And now millions of people across the world
            enjoy listening to this very unique and refreshing genre of music.
